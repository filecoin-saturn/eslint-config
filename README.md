# Saturn's ESLint Configuration

This repo contains Saturn's [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration, which should be shared and enforced across all of Saturn's JavaScript code.

To best do this, this repo is:

  * Published to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
  * Extended in all of Saturn's JavaScript repos.

See ESLint's [docs](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs) for more information on how to accomplish this.
